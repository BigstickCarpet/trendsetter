Trendsetter is a simple REST API and website that I use for demos and [training](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/super-powered-api-testing/tree/v1#super-powered-api-testing). It demonstrates various aspects of web development, API development, and testing.

**The idea is simple:**<br>
Trendsetter lets you set trends. That is, you get to decide _what's_ trendy, and _when_.
Are bell-bottoms due for a comeback? Is the handlebar mustache fad over? Has Crystal Pepsi
become so retro that it's cool now? The decision is all yours

**There's just one rule:**<br>
Once something's trendy, it can't be trendy again for 10 years. So you'll have to wait just a
_little bit longer_ before resurrecting MySpace.
